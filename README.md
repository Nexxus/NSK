Nexxus Stock Keeping
==========

A Symfony project created on March 7, 2017, 11:08 am.

This project is for keeping track of objects.

It started when I was manager in a thrift store and I wanted to sell used computers. There was no way to keep track of the computers and to know in what state they were in. Since we operated multiple stores, I also needed to keep track of the computers at several locations and which ones were sold.

The software evolved and it became possible to also keep track of other objects besides computers. Also a billing part was introduced so we could use it as a point of sales. Since we picked up objects through the country, I needed a way to keep track of logistics and distribution.

Most of the whishes have been implemented, however it was build on a shady foundation. Last year the Lead Developer, Ben aka Nebbii, decided to start developing from the ground up. Nexxus is version 2.0 and is build on Symfony.
